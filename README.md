# Home Server
My main server repository for home use.<br>
It currently hosts several services that make my life more fun and easier:

- **[Traefik Proxy](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/traefik "Traefik proxy")** - I use it as a reverse proxy for service routing, HTTPS connection and certificate issuance.
- **[Duplicati ](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/duplicati "Duplicati")** - I use it for file-cloud backups.
- **[Plex](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/plex "Plex")** - Media server for watching movies and music.
- **[QBittorrent](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/qbittorrent "QBittorrent")** - Torrent to download movies and music directly through the [web UI](https://github.com/ntoporcov/iQbit "web UI")
- **[NextCloud](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud "NextCloud")** - A personal cloud for storing files.
- **[Ksmi-Site](http://ksmi.me "Ksmi-Site")** - My personal site.
- **[YouTrack](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/jetbrains/youtrack "YouTrack")** - I use it as a task tracker for personal projects.

## Infrastructure management

- Start all: `make start`
- Stop all: `make stop`
- Restart all: `make restart`
- Upgrade all: `make upgrade`

<br>

- Update secondary sources: `make sources.update`
- Download secondary sources: `make sources.get`

<br>

- Print all component names: `make help.names`
- Print current config: `make help.config`
- Print template config: `make help.config.template`

<br>

- Stop component by name: `make component.stop component=<name>`
- Start component by name: `make component.start component=<name>`
- Upgrade component by name: `make component.upgrade component=<name>`

## Overview
Next I will try to give some general information about the infrastructure and how things work.

### Adding a component
In the context of infrastructure, I call a component one or more services in `components/<component_name>.yaml` file. For example, the **nextcloud** component contains `nextcloud_app`, `nextcloud_db`, `nexcloud_cron` and `redis`.

#### 1. Component creation
Create `components/<component_name>.yaml` file with the service description for the component. This is a regular [docker-compose.yaml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/ "docker-compose.yaml") of version 3.7 or higher.

#### 2. Component  register
In `сonfig/components.json` you must register a new component, this will link its name to the file. To do this, add the following lines:
```json
{
  "components": [
....
    {
      "name": "<component_name>",
      "file": "<component_name>.yaml"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Add component data
Create the directory `data/<component_name>` and mount all the necessary volumes, this will organize the container data for future use.

#### 3. Component  start
After that, you will need to restart the entire infrastructure or just this component:
```shell
$ make restart 
#or 
$ make componen.start component=<component_name> 
```

### Additionally
With this approach, the infrastructure can be flexibly scaled by removing or adding new components. Also, since data important for component operation is stored in the `data/<component_name>` directory, you can quickly set up backups.

For more flexible and convenient management of the infrastructure, I wrote several utilities in JS, which cover all the basic cases of interaction with components. The commands to run them are described in the **Makefile** and can be seen above in the management section.

Within this framework I'm sticking to using images with the **latest** tag. This is done to update components quickly and since this is my home infrastructure I do it about once every 2 weeks by running the `make upgrade` command.

> But I advise not to use this approach in production in commercial projects since it will cause probable failures.

### RoadMap
1.  Вынести все абсолютные пути томов в переменные окружения
2. Создать скрипт для генерации .env
3. Вынести конфигурацию Traefik в yaml файлы (отделить от докера)
